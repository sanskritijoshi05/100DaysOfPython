✍️ Notes & Reflections
I learned how Python handles different data types and why converting between them is crucial for user input. Understanding f-strings made formatting cleaner and more intuitive.

The Tip Calculator helped me solidify these concepts in a real-world example. Debugging small issues like type errors helped improve my confidence.
